        'While we will briefly touch upon some of the ethereum blockchain environment the most import outcome is that the reader learns about the ethereum environment and actually runs a full copy of the go-ethereum application and ends up with a working copy of the ethereum blockchain on their computer.\n\n'
        'This app is not a history lesson in fiat currencies, political lesson in decentralisation, metallurgist lesson in numismatics, finanial app about destributed ledger technology, fx currency exchange lesson, etc. That is for the reader to discern in their own time.\n\n'
        '3, There are also movements towards Proof of Stake which is a new eth blockchain concept. The founding and running blockchain is using a heavy mathematical algorithm called Proof of Work. Ethereum relies on computer processing power and this power is supplied by fossil fuels. Development is ongoing and requires new thoughts in code and collaboration.\n\n'
        'on of the aims is to eliminate computer processing (power waste). There are numerous ideas being presented in order to create a greater online environment while increasing computing contract options.\n');
